# CLI-APP Missing Features Review

## Executive Summary

This document identifies what features CLI-APP is **missing** that the old CLI **has**, so we can implement them in CLI-APP to achieve feature parity.

## What CLI-APP Needs to Implement

### Missing from CLI-APP (that old CLI has)

#### Critical Missing Slash Commands

1. **`/context` Command System** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Context management (set, get, list, switch)
   - Work context and goals tracking
   - Session switching capabilities
   - **Impact:** Users lose important workflow continuity features

2. **`/create-prd` vs `/prd`** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - Old CLI has dedicated `/create-prd` with custom structure
   - New CLI only has generic `/prd`
   - **Impact:** Loss of specialized PRD creation workflow

3. **`/history` Command** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - Show past PRDs and work
   - Historical work tracking
   - **Impact:** Users can't review previous work sessions

4. **`/prds` Management System** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - List and manage PRDs (list, recent, search)
   - PRD organization and retrieval
   - **Impact:** Loss of PRD management capabilities

5. **`/prd` Advanced Operations** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - PRD show/delete/export with IDs
   - Detailed PRD manipulation
   - **Impact:** Reduced PRD management functionality

6. **`/reasoning` Toggle** ⚠️ **LOW PRIORITY**
   - Toggle AI reasoning display
   - Debug/transparency feature
   - **Impact:** Loss of AI transparency feature

7. **`/quit` Command** ⚠️ **LOW PRIORITY**
   - Explicit exit command
   - **Impact:** Minor UX inconsistency

#### Missing Utility Features

8. **Advanced Command System** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
   - Command argument validation
   - Command completion and hints
   - Local vs agent-handled command distinction
   - **Impact:** Reduced command system sophistication

9. **Enhanced Streaming Handler** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
   - Reasoning token detection and display
   - Advanced progress indicators with context
   - Loading states with preview
   - **Impact:** Less sophisticated streaming UX

10. **ASCII Art & Visual Elements** ⚠️ **LOW PRIORITY**
    - Rich welcome banners and logos
    - Terminal markdown formatting
    - Progress bars and animations
    - **Impact:** Less visually appealing interface

11. **Configuration Command** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
    - Dedicated `agentpm config` command
    - Interactive configuration management
    - **Impact:** Missing critical configuration interface

12. **Advanced Output Management** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
    - OutputManager class with rich formatting
    - Spinner management and status indication
    - **Impact:** Less polished output handling

#### Missing Core Utilities

13. **Enhanced Input System** ⚠️ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
    - Multi-line input support (backslash continuation)
    - Enhanced prompting with placeholders
    - **Impact:** Less flexible input handling

14. **Advanced Error Handling** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
    - Custom error classes (AgentPMError, ConfigurationError)
    - Verbose error reporting
    - Async error wrappers
    - **Impact:** Less robust error handling

15. **Configuration Persistence** ⚠️ **HIGH PRIORITY**
    - `~/.agentpm/config.json` file management
    - Environment variable overrides
    - **Impact:** Loss of persistent configuration

#### 16. **Onboarding/First-time Setup** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
   - Interactive configuration setup for new users
   - Global config file creation (`~/.agentpm/config.json`)
   - Agent URL and API key setup wizard
   - **Impact:** New users can't easily get started

## Priority Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Missing Features (Week 1)

1. **Onboarding/Setup** - Interactive first-time configuration setup
2. **Configuration Command** - Implement `agentpm config` command in CLI-APP
3. **Context Management** - Port `/context` command system
4. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling framework

### Phase 2: Important Features (Week 2)

5. **PRD Management** - Port `/prds` and advanced `/prd` operations
6. **Enhanced Streaming** - Port advanced streaming handler with reasoning
7. **Command System** - Implement argument validation and completion
8. **History Management** - Implement `/history` command

### Phase 3: Polish & Nice-to-Have (Week 3)

9. **Visual Enhancements** - Port ASCII art and visual elements
10. **Multi-line Input** - Implement enhanced input system
11. **Reasoning Toggle** - Implement reasoning display toggle

## Architecture Recommendations

### What to Implement in CLI-APP

```
CLI-APP needs these features from old CLI:
├── commands/
│   ├── config.ts         # Port configuration management
│   ├── onboarding.ts     # First-time setup wizard
├── slash-commands/
│   ├── context.ts        # /context command system
│   ├── history.ts        # /history command  
│   ├── prds.ts          # /prds management
│   └── reasoning.ts     # /reasoning toggle
├── utils/
│   ├── streaming.ts      # Enhanced streaming with reasoning
│   ├── errors.ts         # Robust error handling
│   └── config-file.ts   # Global config file management
```

### Key Principles
1. **Feature Parity First** - Ensure CLI-APP has all old CLI features
2. **No Regressions** - Don't lose any working functionality
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with basic implementations, enhance over time
4. **Maintainability** - Keep code organized and well-documented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Audit Implementation** - Review CLI-APP against this list
2. **Create Migration Tasks** - Break down each missing feature into implementable tasks
3. **Prioritize by User Impact** - Focus on features users rely on most
4. **Test Thoroughly** - Ensure no regressions during feature additions

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Consolidate Codebases** - Eventually deprecate old CLI once CLI-APP has full parity
2. **Documentation** - Update all documentation to reflect new features
3. **User Migration** - Provide smooth transition path for existing users
4. **Feature Enhancement** - Build upon solid foundation with new TUI-specific features

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All slash commands from old CLI working in CLI-APP
- [ ] Configuration management fully functional
- [ ] File operations implemented (not mocked)
- [ ] Error handling as robust as old CLI
- [ ] No user-reported regressions
- [ ] Enhanced TUI features provide better UX than old CLI
