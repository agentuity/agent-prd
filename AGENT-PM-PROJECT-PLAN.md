# AgentPM: Complete Project Plan & Tracking

## Project Overview

**AgentPM** is an AI-powered product management assistant that helps engineers create PRDs, brainstorm features, and get PM coaching through natural conversation.

### Architecture
- **AgentPRD**: Agentuity cloud agent (the brain) - handles all AI reasoning, PM logic, memory
- **CLI Client**: Lightweight `agentpm` binary for terminal interaction
- **Multi-channel Ready**: Same agent works with email, Slack, Discord via Agentuity SDK

### Key Design Principles
1. **Agent-First**: All intelligence lives in the cloud agent, clients are just interfaces
2. **Coding Agent UX**: Interactive REPL with short commands like Codex CLI
3. **Approval Modes**: `suggest` â†’ `auto-edit` â†’ `full-auto` for safety
4. **Cross-channel Context**: Conversations continue seamlessly across channels

## Technical Stack

### Phase 4: Polish & Distribution (Weeks 11-12)
**Status**: Not Started

**Both Components**:
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Binary distribution setup
- [ ] Security audit and improvements

**Future Considerations**:
- [ ] Linear integration
- [ ] Team collaboration features
- [ ] Plugin system for extensibility
- [ ] Email/Slack channel integration

## User Experience Design

### Interaction Patterns
```bash
# Interactive REPL Mode
$ agentpm
AgentPM> Help me create a PRD for a mobile task management app
ðŸ¤– I'll help you create that PRD. Let me ask a few questions...

# Direct Command Mode  
$ agentpm "Create a PRD for a SaaS analytics dashboard"
ðŸ¤– I'll create a PRD for a SaaS analytics dashboard...

# Short Commands (within REPL)
AgentPM> /templates
AgentPM> /template saas-product
AgentPM> /export pdf
AgentPM> /brainstorm "improve user retention"
```

### Approval Modes
- **suggest** (default): Agent proposes, user approves each action
- **auto-edit**: Agent can write/modify files automatically
- **full-auto**: Agent operates autonomously within constraints

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- CLI startup time: <2 seconds
- Agent response time: <5 seconds for simple requests
- User retention after first use: >60%
- CLI bundle size: <100KB

### Product Metrics
- PRDs created per user per month
- Template usage and sharing rates
- User progression through coaching modules
- Cross-channel usage patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI API reliability**: Multiple provider fallbacks, local caching
- **Network connectivity**: Offline mode with local templates
- **Agent performance**: Intelligent model routing, response caching

### Product Risks
- **User adoption**: Extensive user testing, gradual feature rollout
- **Feature complexity**: Start simple, add complexity based on usage
- **Competition**: Focus on terminal-native experience differentiation

## Implementation Status Tracking

### Week 1 Progress
- [x] Project planning and architecture design completed
- [x] Technology stack finalized
- [x] Documentation framework established
- [ ] **NEXT**: Initialize CLI project structure
- [ ] **NEXT**: Set up basic agent communication

### Current Sprint Goals
1. Get basic CLI project scaffolded with Bun
2. Implement basic REPL with command parsing
3. Set up HTTP client for agent communication
4. Create basic agent endpoint for testing

### Blockers & Dependencies
- **AgentPRD Setup**: Need existing agent in AgentPRD folder configured
- **API Keys**: Need Agentuity authentication configured
- **Testing**: Need test endpoints for agent communication
