# Testing the Approval Workflow

## How to Test the Complete TUI

The new AgentPM TUI includes all the features from the project plan:

### ✅ Completed Features:

1. **Basic Ink TUI Structure**
   - React + Ink components
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Component-based architecture

2. **Core Chat Interface**
   - Interactive input with real-time feedback
   - Message history with timestamps
   - Command submission and display

3. **Streaming & Real-time Updates**
   - Live streaming response updates
   - Visual streaming indicators (blinking cursor, "streaming..." text)
   - Border color changes during streaming (cyan → yellow)

4. **Enhanced Output**
   - Markdown rendering for agent responses
   - Support for headers, code blocks, lists, bold, italic
   - Syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Structured content display

5. **Advanced Interactions**
   - Input history navigation (up/down arrows)
   - Command history persistence
   - Slash command parsing
   - Session management

6. **Approval Workflows**
   - ApprovalDialog component with Y/N/E/A options
   - CommandPreview showing pending actions
   - Action type icons and color coding
   - Keyboard navigation through actions

### Current State:
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete (Foundation Setup)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Complete (Core Chat Interface) 
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Complete (Streaming & Enhanced Output)
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Complete (Advanced Interactions & Approval)

### To Test Approval Workflow:

1. The TUI will show approval dialogs when the agent returns `needsApproval: true` with actions
2. Use arrow keys to navigate between actions
3. Press Y/N/E to approve/deny/edit
4. See visual feedback with colored borders and icons

### Architecture Achievements:

✅ **Component-based architecture** (like Codex CLI)
✅ **Real-time streaming updates** with React state
✅ **Interactive approval workflows** with keyboard navigation
✅ **Rich markdown rendering** for agent responses
✅ **Command history** with arrow key navigation
✅ **Visual feedback** throughout the interface
✅ **Error handling** and loading states
✅ **Session management** with the agent client

The TUI successfully transforms the traditional CLI into a modern, interactive terminal application that matches the OpenAI Codex CLI patterns!
