# AgentPM: AI-Powered Product Management CLI Tool

## Project Overview
AgentPM is an AI-powered command-line interface tool designed to help engineers create product requirements documents, brainstorm features, and receive product management coaching - all from the terminal.

The project consists of two main components:
- **AgentPRD**: Agentuity cloud agent that handles LLM calls and agentic workflows
- **CLI**: Lightweight client (`agentpm` binary) that interacts with the remote agent

Based on ChatPRD's features and functionality, this tool brings AI-assisted product management capabilities to the command line with a client-server architecture.

## Technical Architecture

### Component Architecture
- **AgentPRD (Agentuity Agent)**: 
  - AI integration (Groq for fast/structured, OpenAI o-3 for thinking)
  - Agentuity KV storage for agent memory and context
  - Document processing and generation
  - Template management
- **CLI Client (`agentpm`)**: 
  - Lightweight Bun-based CLI binary
  - HTTP client for agent communication
  - Local caching and offline capabilities
  - Terminal UI for interactions

### Core Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **CLI Library**: Commander.js + Enquirer (lightweight prompts)
- **TUI Components**: Simple terminal output + prompts (no heavy frameworks)
- **AI Integration**: Agentuity agent with mixed AI providers
- **Storage**: Agentuity KV storage for persistence
- **Export**: Markdown-first with optional PDF generation

### CLI Structure
```
agentpm
├── create-prd          # Interactive PRD creation
├── brainstorm          # Ideation and roadmap planning  
├── coach              # Product management coaching
├── templates          # Template management
├── export             # Document export utilities
├── collaborate        # Team collaboration features
├── config             # Configuration and settings
└── login              # Agentuity authentication
```

### Data Storage
- **Agentuity KV Storage**: Documents, templates, user context
- **Local Cache**: Offline capability and performance
- **Agent Memory**: Conversation history and learning

## User Experience Design

### CLI Commands
```bash
# Authentication
agentpm login
agentpm logout

# PRD Creation
agentpm create-prd "mobile app for task management"
agentpm create-prd --template="saas-product" --interactive

# Brainstorming
agentpm brainstorm "improve user retention"
agentpm brainstorm --scenario="competitive-threat"

# Coaching
agentpm coach --skill-assessment
agentpm coach --review-document ./my-prd.md

# Templates
agentpm templates list
agentpm templates create --name="my-template"
agentpm templates share --template="my-template"

# Export
agentpm export ./my-prd.md --format=pdf
agentpm export ./my-prd.md --format=confluence

# Configuration
agentpm config set agent-url https://your-agent.agentuity.com
agentpm config list
```

### User Interface Design (Coding Agent Style)
- **Interactive REPL**: Like Codex CLI - conversational interface with the agent
- **Short Commands**: `/create-prd`, `/template`, `/export`, `/brainstorm` style commands
- **Approval Modes**: 
  - `suggest` (default): Agent suggests, user approves
  - `auto-edit`: Agent can write files directly
  - `full-auto`: Agent operates autonomously
- **Streaming Output**: Real-time AI response streaming with think-aloud
- **File Operations**: Agent can read/write PRDs, templates with user approval
- **Session Memory**: Agent remembers context across the conversation
- **Multi-channel Ready**: Same agent logic works for CLI, email, Slack, Discord

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Terminal-Native**: Fits seamlessly into developer workflows
2. **Offline Capable**: Core functionality works without internet
3. **Version Control Friendly**: Git integration and diff-friendly formats
4. **Customizable**: Extensive template and configuration system
5. **Role-Agnostic**: Serves engineers, PMs, and designers equally well

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Time to generate first PRD (target: <2 minutes)
- User retention after first use (target: >60%)
- Average session duration (target: 15-20 minutes)

### Product Metrics
- Number of PRDs created per user per month
- Template usage and sharing rates
- User progression through coaching modules

### Business Metrics
- Monthly active users
- User satisfaction score (NPS)
- Feature adoption rates

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI API Reliability**: Implement fallback mechanisms and caching
- **TUI Complexity**: Start with simple interface, iterate based on feedback
- **Performance**: Optimize for fast startup and response times

### Product Risks
- **Feature Bloat**: Focus on core use cases first, expand methodically
- **User Adoption**: Extensive user testing and feedback collection
- **Competition**: Differentiate through terminal-native experience

## Next Steps

1. **Research TUI Libraries**: Evaluate options for Bun/Node ecosystem
2. **AI Integration Planning**: Choose AI provider and design integration
3. **MVP Definition**: Define minimum viable product for first release
4. **User Research**: Interview target users (engineers, PMs, designers)
5. **Technical Proof of Concept**: Build basic PRD generation functionality

## Questions for Consideration

1. Should we integrate with existing tools (Jira, Linear, Notion)?
2. What's the preferred AI model/provider for this use case?
3. How important is offline functionality vs cloud-based features?
4. Should we build our own template format or use existing standards?
5. What's the target deployment method (npm package, standalone binary)?
