# Agent-First Architecture for AgentPM

## Core Design Principle
**The Agentuity agent is the brain, clients are just interfaces.**

All product management logic, AI reasoning, template management, and state lives in the AgentPRD agent. Clients (CLI, email, Slack, Discord) are lightweight interfaces that send natural language requests and receive responses.

## Agent-Centric Architecture

## Interaction Patterns (Inspired by Codex CLI)

### 1. Interactive REPL Mode
```bash
$ agentpm
AgentPM> Help me create a PRD for a mobile task management app

🤖 I'll help you create a comprehensive PRD for a mobile task management app. 
Let me ask a few questions to understand your vision better.

What's the primary user segment you're targeting?
📝 [a] Individual professionals
📝 [b] Small teams (2-10 people)  
📝 [c] Enterprise teams (10+ people)
📝 [d] Students/personal use

AgentPM> b

🤖 Great! Small teams have unique collaboration needs. Now, what's the core 
problem you're solving that existing solutions don't address well?

AgentPM> Current tools are either too simple or too complex. We need something 
that grows with the team but starts simple.

🤖 Perfect insight! I'll create a PRD focusing on progressive complexity. 
Would you like me to:

📋 Generate a full PRD now
🎯 Use a specific template (SaaS, Mobile, Feature)
💡 Brainstorm features first
📝 Start with a brief and expand

AgentPM> /generate-full-prd

🤖 Creating comprehensive PRD for "Progressive Task Management for Small Teams"...

[Streaming AI-generated content with real-time display]

✅ PRD generated! Saved to: `./team-task-app-prd.md`

Would you like me to:
📤 Export to PDF
📧 Prepare for sharing
🔄 Iterate on specific sections
💡 Brainstorm implementation roadmap

AgentPM> /export pdf

🤖 Exporting to PDF... ✅ Done! 
📁 `./team-task-app-prd.pdf` ready for sharing
```

### 2. Direct Command Mode
```bash
$ agentpm "Create a PRD for a SaaS analytics dashboard"
🤖 I'll create a PRD for a SaaS analytics dashboard...
[AI generates and streams response]

$ agentpm --approval-mode auto-edit "Add user authentication section to my PRD"
🤖 Reading existing PRD... Adding authentication section...
✅ Updated PRD with comprehensive authentication section

$ agentpm --approval-mode full-auto "Export all my PRDs to PDF format"
🤖 Found 3 PRDs... Exporting to PDF...
✅ 3 PDFs generated in ./exports/
```

### 3. Short Commands (Within REPL)
```bash
AgentPM> /templates
Available templates:
📱 mobile-app
🌐 saas-product  
⚡ feature-enhancement
🏢 enterprise-solution
✨ startup-mvp

AgentPM> /template saas-product

AgentPM> /brainstorm "improve user retention"
🤖 Let's brainstorm user retention strategies...

AgentPM> /coach "review my PRD writing skills"
🤖 I'll analyze your recent PRDs and provide personalized coaching...

AgentPM> /export confluence
🤖 Converting to Confluence format...
```

## Multi-Channel Consistency

### The Agent's Universal Interface
All channels send the same format to the agent:
```typescript
interface AgentRequest {
  userId: string;
  channel: 'cli' | 'email' | 'slack' | 'discord' | 'web';
  message: string;
  context?: {
    sessionId?: string;
    files?: FileAttachment[];
    approvalMode?: 'suggest' | 'auto-edit' | 'full-auto';
  };
}

interface AgentResponse {
  content: string;
  actions?: Action[];
  files?: GeneratedFile[];
  needsApproval?: boolean;
  sessionId: string;
}
```

### Channel-Specific Formatting
The agent handles response formatting per channel:
```typescript
// CLI: Rich terminal output with colors, progress bars
// Email: Clean HTML with attachments
// Slack: Formatted blocks with interactive elements  
// Discord: Embeds with file attachments
```

## Agent Memory & Learning

### Conversation Context (KV Storage)
```typescript
// Session memory
context.kv.set('sessions', sessionId, {
  userId,
  channel,
  conversation: [...messages],
  activeProject: 'mobile-task-app',
  preferences: { template: 'saas', exportFormat: 'pdf' }
});

// User learning
context.kv.set('users', userId, {
  skillLevel: 'intermediate',
  preferredStyle: 'detailed',
  commonTemplates: ['saas-product', 'mobile-app'],
  feedbackHistory: [...],
  improvementAreas: ['user research', 'metrics definition']
});
```

### Cross-Channel Continuity
```bash
# User starts on CLI
$ agentpm "Start a PRD for a fintech app"

# Later continues via Slack
@agentpm continue working on that fintech PRD we started

# Agent responds with full context from CLI session
🤖 Continuing with your fintech app PRD from earlier...
```

## Approval Modes & Safety

### Suggest Mode (Default)
- Agent proposes actions, waits for approval
- Safe for all operations
- Good for learning and review

### Auto-Edit Mode  
- Agent can write/modify files automatically
- Still asks before major structural changes
- Efficient for iterative work

### Full-Auto Mode
- Agent operates autonomously within constraints  
- All operations sandboxed to project directory
- Maximum efficiency for trusted scenarios

## Benefits of Agent-First Design

1. **Consistent Experience**: Same AI logic across all channels
2. **Rich Memory**: Agent learns and improves across all interactions
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add new channels without duplicating logic
4. **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for product management logic
5. **Intelligent**: Agent can correlate patterns across different interaction modes
6. **Future-Proof**: Ready for voice, web UI, API integrations

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Build robust agent with CLI client
2. **Phase 2**: Add email/Slack integration using existing Agentuity features
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced cross-channel features and learning
4. **Phase 4**: Public API for third-party integrations

This architecture ensures we build a truly intelligent PM assistant that users can interact with however they prefer, while maintaining consistency and continuity across all channels.
